### Help, my field is blank!!! ###

In order to generate data for a particular field, this extension requires a [field adapter](https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/random_entries_generator/blob/master/lib/class.fieldadapter.php)
that will populate the data in the database.

We currently support only core fields.
If a field stays blank, it's probably because the adapter for it does not exists.

You can [look here](https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/random_entries_generator/tree/master/lib/adapters)
to see if there is already an adapter for the field in question. If not, feel free
to implement it (it's really easy!) and send a Pull Request.
